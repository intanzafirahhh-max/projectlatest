            <h2>My Mother ❤️</h2>
            <p>
                My mother name is Che Rodeyah, the most important person in my life. 
                She has raised me with so much love, strength, and patience. 
                Even though our small family only consists of the two of us, 
                she always makes sure I grow up surrounded with kindness, support, and guidance.

            <p>
                My father name is Maziza, passed away when I was only 6 months old. 
                Even though I never had the chance to know him, 
                I always carry the thought of him in my heart. 
                I believe he would be proud of the person I am becoming today.

            <h2>The Only Child 👧🏻</h2>
            <p>
                Growing up as an only child was a unique journey. 
                It taught me how to be independent, strong, and responsible from a young age.  
                My small family may not be big, but it is full of love, memories, and strength.
